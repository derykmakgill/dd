You can contact me at **hello@mkgll.com**.

<p>I'm a writer and researcher who likes to understand how people work. I try to engage in both theory and practice, which means I'm always cycling between writing to understand a topic, then finding ways to test those ideas in the "real world."</p>

   <p>I'm currently interested in parasocial communities and reputation-based economies. I work at <a href="https://substack.com/">Substack</a>.</p>

   <p>Previously, I focused on open source software, working independently and at GitHub to improve the developer experience. I recently published a book about open source developers called <em>Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance of Open Source Software</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0578675862/">available for pre-order</a>).</p>

   <p>I occasionally write on this website (<a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a>), and I also publish my <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/notes/">notes</a> every month. For future updates, you can sign up for my <a href="https://nayafia.substack.com/">monthly newsletter</a>, where I share my writing, notes, and anything interesting I've read.</p>

   <p><strong>If you'd like to get in touch</strong>, find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/nayafia">@nayafia</a> or email <em>nadia.eghbal@gmail.com</em>. Fair warning: If I don't respond, or take a very long time to respond, it's not personal, I'm just terrible at email (although I am more responsive to short emails).</p>

We spent our mornings binging on history and our afternoons drinking beers in the river: a quiet, wide-mouthed expanse of cool, fresh water, surrounded by grassy clusters of giant flat rocks and sandy banks.</p>
